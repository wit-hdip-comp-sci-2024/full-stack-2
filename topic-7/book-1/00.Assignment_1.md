# Assignment Specification.

## Overview.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your knowledge of the React framework and ecosystem by designing and developing a SPA. The app may extend the Movies app developed in the labs (preferred option) or bespoke.

__Completion__: 31/08/2025.

__CA Mark__: 60%.

__Deliverables__:
A text file (**assignment.txt**) containing:

+ The URL of your source code GitHub repo.
+ The URL of your YouTube video demonstrating your app.

1. The README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and **must be complete and accurate**.
1. You must maintain a detailed Git commit history throughout the assignment period. I would advise that you commit at least once for every development session. Commit messages must always state the purpose of each session, whether completed or not - **the 'only commit working code' principle need not always apply.**
1. You may be requested to complete a **short Zoom interview in the 1st week of September** to present your work.

## Grading spectrum.

Each grade band (e.g. Pass, Good, Very Good, Excellent) lists **example features or capabilities** that can help you reach that band. **You donâ€™t have to implement every single feature** in a band to earn that grade. **Quality and selection** matter more than just ticking boxes. You can mix features from multiple bands.

## Use of AI

If you use AI to support your development process, do not let it replace your understanding. For example, AI can be used as a learning aid to understand how a feature works (e.g., how does React Query do caching? or Why do we use `useEffect` here?), or how to implement something properly (e.g., how to set up private routing in React). 
Do not just copy and paste or accept AI-generated code with no understanding what it does(*"blind vibe coding"*). You should understand and be able to explain your code.  Where detected, unacceptable use of AI can result in 0 and you will be requested to redo the assignment.
