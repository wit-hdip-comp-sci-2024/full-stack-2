## Exercise.

Objective: In the Movie Details page, display the red heart icon in the page header if the movie was tagged as a favourite.

![][exercise]

Be aware that your solution can only work partially as expected due to the deficiencies in the favourite tagging logic explained earlier. Test your solution with the following process:

1. Go to the home page.
1. Tag a movie as a favourite.
1. Navigate to that movie's details page by using the 'More Info' link. The red heart should appear in the page header.
1. Navigate back to the home page. The tagged favourite is no longer selected.

[Hint: The only file you need to edit to complete this exercise is ``components/headerMovie/index.tsx``. The movies tagged as favourites are stored in localstorage, which any component can access.]

On completion, commit the changes:
~~~bash
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Exercise - Show favourite icon on Movie Details page.."
$ git push origin main
~~~
