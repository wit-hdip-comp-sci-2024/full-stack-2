## The Bootstrap CSS library.

The current styling problem in our app is due to the omission of the Bootstrap CSS file. Stop the server and install it from the integrated terminal as follows:
~~~
$ npm install --save  bootstrap@4.4.1
$ npm run dev
~~~
The traditional approach (which we won't use) to referencing CSS is by adding a link tag to `index.html`, e.g.
~~~
<link href="... path to CSS file ..." rel="stylesheet">
~~~
A newer and more developer-friendly approach is to reference it directly from the JS code. Add an import to `src/main.tsx`:

~~~
import '../node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css'
~~~
and remove the line:
~~~
import './index.css'
~~~

The app should now be rendering as planned. 

Commit this work:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Styled with Bootstrap."
