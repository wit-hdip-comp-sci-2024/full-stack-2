## Exercise.

TMDB has several **endpoints** for requesting data. We have already used four: Discover, Movies, Genres, and Reviews. The Movies endpoint has several query options; for example, 'upcoming' will returns a list of movies that will soon appear in cinemas - see more [here][endpoint]). According to the TMDB documentation, the upcoming movies endpoint URL is:

>> https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/upcoming?api_key=...your-key...&language=en-US&page=1

**You are required** to add a new page to the app which displays a list of upcoming movies. 
The new page's URL should be '/movies/upcoming', and the page's layout should closely mirror that of the home page. The site header should include a navigation link to this page:



![][upcoming]

[Note, there may be some overlap between the movies in the upcoming list and the discover list (the home page). This overlap is normal for TMDB.]

On completing the exercise, update the git repository:

```
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Added Upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin main
```

[endpoint]: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-upcoming
[upcoming]: ./img/upcoming.png
[discover]: ./img/discover.png
[favorites]: ./img/favorites.png
