# Exercises.
## Exercise 1.

The Upcoming movies page you developed in the previous lab no longer works due to the refactoring we carried out. Make the necessary adjustments to your code to get it working again.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Fix upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin main
~~~
## Exercise 2.

Suppose we want the movies on the Upcoming movies page to have a different action icon(s), as shown below:

![][buttonw]

The icon is called PlaylistAdd: 

![][playlistadd]

Ultimately, it should allow users to add the movie to their 'Must watch' list. For now, you only need this icon to render on the page's movie cards - it does not need to trigger any action.

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "New button for Upcoming movies page."
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 3.

Currently, the Upcoming movies page uses the useEffect hook to retrieve the list of movies. Consequently, an HTTP request is made to TMDB every time the page is mounted. A better solution would be to cache the films in the browser using the react-query library. 

__You are required__ to change the implementation to meet this requirement. On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Change upcoming movies page to use caching."
$ git push origin main
~~~

## Exercise 4.

Returning to the PlaylistAdd icon in Exercise 2, suppose clicking it adds the movie to a 'Must Watch' list, similar to the Favourites feature. __You are required__ to implement this requirement. For convenience, skip the creation of a seperate 'Must Watch' page in your solution.

[Hint: Add a new state variable (of type array) to the MoviesContext for storing the ids of the movies tagged as 'must watch', and add a function for updating this state variable. Have a click event handler associated with the icon that calls the update function. To confirm the feature is working, use console.log to output the content of the new state variable array.]

On completion, update your repository:
~~~
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Tagging upcoming movies as must-watch."
$ git push origin main
~~~

-----------------------------
Ideally, the tagged movie should be reflected on the Upcoming movies page, as shown below:

![][mustwatch]

This feature would require significant refactoring, but you are not required to tackle this.
