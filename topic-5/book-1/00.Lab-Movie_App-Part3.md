# Developing a Movies Fan App - Part 3.

In this lab, we tackle the third development iteration of the Movies Fan app. 

From the feature list mentioned in Part 1 of this series, we will now implement the following:

+ In the Movie details page, the user can optionally show an excerpt from published critic reviews.
+ Clicking the 'More' link on a review excerpt will display the full review text on a separate page.
+ A more professional-styled site header is added.

We will use two new React coding techniques in the implementation:

+ A Component composition pattern.
+ Custom hooks.

Also, we will utilize the Extended Link routing featured.
