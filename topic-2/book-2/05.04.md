## Hot Module Replacement (HMR).

When a source code file/module is edited, Vite re-transpiles it and sends it down to the browser to replace the old version, i.e. Hot module replacement. HMR allows the developer to see the effect of the change immediately. As a simple example, in `src/App.tsx`, replace the line:
~~~
  const name = "MSc Enterprise Software Systems";
~~~
with:
~~~
  const name = "Masters in Enterprise Software Systems";
~~~
Save the change and switch to the browser to see the changed UI.

The instant feedback of HMR also aids debugging. In `components/programme.tsx` change the line:
~~~
  const list = props.modules.map((module, index) => (

~~~
with:
~~~
  const list = props.allmodules.map((module, index) => (
~~~
The replaced module in the browser causes an error, which we discover immediately:

![][error]

Undo the change to fix the error.
