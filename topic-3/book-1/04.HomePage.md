## Assembling the Home page.

We can now bring the components together to form a page in the app. 

+ Add the following interface description to `/types/interfaces.ts`

~~~tsx
 export interface BaseMovieListProps { 
    movies: BaseMovie[];
  }   
~~~



Create the file `src/pages/homePage.tsx` and paste in this code:

~~~tsx
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/headerMovieList";
import Grid from "@mui/material/Grid";
import MovieList from "../components/movieList";
import { BaseMovieListProps } from "../types/interfaces";
 
const styles = {
  root: {
    padding: "20px",
  },
};



const MovieListPage: React.FC<BaseMovieListProps> = ({movies}) => {
  return (
    <Grid container sx={styles.root}>
      <Grid item xs={12}>
        <Header title={"Home Page"} />
      </Grid>
      <Grid item container spacing={5}>
        <MovieList movies={movies}></MovieList>
      </Grid>
    </Grid>
  );
};
export default MovieListPage;
~~~
Also, create the file `src/components/movieList/index.tsx` (referenced by the above code) and add this code:
~~~tsx
import React from "react";
import Movie from "../movieCard/";
import Grid from "@mui/material/Grid";
import { BaseMovieListProps } from "../../types/interfaces";

const MovieList: React.FC<BaseMovieListProps> = ({movies}) => {
  let movieCards = movies.map((m) => (
    <Grid key={m.id} item xs={12} sm={6} md={4} lg={3} xl={2}>
      <Movie key={m.id} {...m} />
    </Grid>
  ));
  return movieCards;
}

  export default MovieList;
~~~
We use the Material's Grid system above to enable a responsive UI. For example, when the browser's viewport is extra-large (xl), we allow six cards per row, whereas a small viewport (sm) allows only two cards per row - see later.

We will eventually plug this page into a routing component. In the meantime, we will statically link it to a top-level component that feeds it an array of movies. 

+ Create `src/index.tsx` and add this code:

~~~tsx
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import HomePage from "./pages/homePage";
import sample from './stories/sampleData'

const movies = [sample, sample, sample, sample, sample, sample, sample];

const App = () => {
  return (
      <HomePage movies={movies} />
  );
};

const rootElement = createRoot(document.getElementById("root")!); 
rootElement.render(<App />);
~~~
The App component is at the top of the component hierarchy - this will change in a future lab. To see the HomePage rendering, stop the StoryBook server and start the development server provided by the Vite tool:
~~~
$ npm run dev
~~~
Click the localhost URL provided in the command response - the page should render as follows:

![][homepage]

A small/mobile browser viewport renders the page as:

![][homepagesm]

Before continuing, from the integrated terminal panel, update the git repository as follows:
~~~ 
$ git add -A
$ git commit -m "Home Page rendering."
$ git push origin main
~~~

[homepage]: ./img/homepage.png
[homepagesm]: ./img/homepagesm.png
