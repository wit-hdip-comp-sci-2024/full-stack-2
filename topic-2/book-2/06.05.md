## Building a production app.

The app is now complete, but the development server environment is not suitable for a public-facing or production app. Transpilation should not be happening dynamically and all file sizes should be **minified**, thus improving load-time performance. To build a production-ready app, stop the development server and type the command:
~~~
npm run build
~~~
This command creates a `dist` folder for the production-quality, static form of the app:

The name of the minified bundle file containing your React code is a computed hash value of its content, e.g. `index-CpcQVJ9k.js`. This naming style aids the browser's caching operations. In `dist/index.html` the script tag references the bundle.


To use the production version of the app, type the command:

~~~
npm run preview
~~~
This starts a standard web server that hosts the 'dist` folder. Open a browser at the web address given in the terminal window, e.g. http://localhost:4173/

Notice in the project's `.gitignore` file (generated by Vite), the `/dist` folder is included - we never commit generated files/folders to a repository. Performing a git commit anytime in the future will exclude the dist files from the repository.
